- How will you test the changes?
In this event, recommended to setup a sandbox environment will be the best option for conducting testing cluster, the sandbox cluster will mimic production cluster to maximize the accuracy of tests. 
This is good practice that we can implement as part of our deployment strategy and Software Development Lifecycle.

- How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
There are some errors prevention methods: example like setup the observability and monitoring for the sandbox cluster where we can monitor the performance metrics using Prometheus and Grafana, 
also we can collect logs and traces to determine the root cause of problems and troubleshoot more eficiently. 
Provide the proper documentation like test cases, and recording all the steps and testing tools that using in the testing stage to avoid any missing steps and test cases.
